# Habits - an iOS App for habits, good and bad

### Description
Habits is a take on traditional reminder apps to help reinforce good habits and break bad habits. For instance,
when using a computer for an extended period of time, it is recommended to sit up straight, have good posture, 
stay hydrated, and to take your eyes away from the computer every so often to let your body relax. However, it 
is difficult to constantly remind yourself to do these things. Habits is made with this problem in mind, to act
as a helpful reminder app for various activities, sending push notifications to users when a certain time has 
passed.

In addition to creating simple reminders, users can create "sessions", which is a group of notifications that can
all activate and deactivate at once. Given the example above, you would normally have to set three reminders, 
start all three, and then when you finish you would have to delete them all and restart the process if you wanted
to do it again. The intent of Habit is to create one session, add your reminders, and then you can simply set all
reminders with a touch of a button.
